    "> With the help of exploratory data analysis techniques and visualizations, we can get the require trend and analyse it. The reviews are from 2008 to 2014, i.e. around six years. The number of reviews per month were increasing sharply from 2010 onwards and it could mean that the fast-food chain was becoming more and more popular between 2010 to 2012 with a peak of almost 100 reviews per month. But there is some decline since then, where we see only 40 customers writing a review every month in 2014. This implies that the company has reached a maturity stage in their business, so to attract new customers, company can experiment with their brand, offerings and relationships."

We can see that over 80% of the customers have given 4 or 5-star ratings, which means that most of the customers are highly satisfied with the restaurant and also, there is no much variation in the rating and it is quite stable at 4.5. Company should capitalize on its frequent and loyal customers and look for strategies to maintain long term relationships with them and retain them using discounts and loyalty programs."

After prepossessing, we can create a word cloud of the corpus to highlight the most frequent words. The more a specific word appears in the text, the bigger and bolder it will be in the word cloud."

However, it discards the word order. But in this case, we need to know the sequence of words. In order to better capture the context, we can consider pairs or triples of words that appear next to each other which gives us more useful information. This process is called N-grams. Here since we need pairs of words, so we will consider Bi-gram."

    "> To get topics out of reviews corpus, we need to perform topic modelling. We can use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to perform topic modelling. In LDA, the modelling process revolves around three things: the text corpus, its collection of documents, and the words in the documents. The LDA algorithm first models documents via a mixture model of topics. From these topics, words are then assigned weights based on the probability distribution of these topics. It is this probabilistic assignment over words that allow a user of LDA to say how likely a particular word falls into a topic. Subsequently from the collection of words assigned to a particular topic, are we thus able to gain an insight as to what that topic may actually represent from a lexical point of view. We can further perform word cloud visualizations on each topic."
